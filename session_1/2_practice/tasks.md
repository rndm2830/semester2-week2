# Library SQL Exercises

## Datetime in SQL

Some of these tasks use datetimes - you can convert a date into the right format using:
```sql
DATE('20-01-2026') /* convert a specific date to a datetime */
DATE('now') /* convert the current time to a datetime */
DATE('now', '-14 days') /* you can add or subtract days */
```
